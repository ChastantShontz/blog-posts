<p>In the past, some web developers would identify as exclusively “front
end developers.” Today, though, this is hardly ever the case. It is
almost impossible to design at only the front end, without touching the
back end, or the server side, at all. This is not to say that developers
have to be a master of every aspect of web development. Specialization
in certain areas should be encouraged, and often ends up happening even
if not intentionally. Especially in a team of developers, it is ideal to
have different members with a wide array of specialties to ensure that
all your bases are covered.</p>
<p>Digital-based organizations are considered to be more “agile” than
traditional ones. This means that they are primarily centered around the
technical aspects of their business, as opposed to it just being one
division in a larger organization. This allows for streamlined
communication and faster innovation. Another benefit is the concept of
continuous delivery, meaning that a digital product is often re-released
time and time again after its initial unveiling. This allows the
developers to get their product out quickly to meet a deadline, while
still continuing to perfect it. New updates and patches can later be
added to fix bugs or add missing features.</p>
<p>Originally, all websites were static, meant to only display text.
HTML, the premier programming language for years, reflected this
purpose. CSS was created to make websites more appealing to look at,
allowing developers to style them with colors and basic transitions.
When websites needed to be more functional, JavaScript was introduced to
fill this void. Despite being created in only ten days by Brendan Eich,
it quickly exploded in popularity to become the universal language
today. The next step in this evolution was the development of webapps.
These are often even more interactive and easier to use, especially on
mobile. The tradeoff, though, is that it sacrifices many fundamental
aspects of the internet, such as a shareable URL.</p>
<p>Browsers have similarly undergone many changes over the years, often
spurred by their competition with each other. There was a time when
developers wanted to move away from HTML4 in favor of XHTML, which
presented several problems of its own and was not even supported on
Internet Explorer. In response to this, browsers like Firefox and Opera
created HTML5 as an alternative. Nowadays, browsers adapt much faster
than before, so the amount of time in between a new feature being
introduced and browsers supporting it is shrinking. Additionally,
browser prefixes can be added in CSS to translate features that are
normally not compatible. Another alternative is polyfills, which provide
a pure JavaScript solution.</p>

Today, JavaScript is the most used programming language in the world.  Anyone who wants to do anything on the web needs to have at least a rudimentary understanding of it.  There was, however, a time when JavaScript was regarded as little more than a joke in the programming community.

JavaScript had its humble beginnings at Netscape in 1995.  It was created in only ten days by a developer named Brendan Eich who, ironically enough, knew little about programming.  It was originally called Mocha, before being changed to LiveScript, and then finally JavaScript in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Java.

But the JavaScript that Eich created in 1995 was not the JavaScript that we know today.  At the time, everyone was trying to develop their own alternative, such as Microsoft’s JScript, which added several new features.  Eventually, the European Computer Manufacturers Association merged all these versions together into a single comprehensive one called ECMAScript, which is what modern JavaScript is derived from.

Another important factor was the limited time that Eich had to make JavaScript originally.  Knowing he could not develop a complete, high-quality language in that timeframe, Eich made JavaScript to be malleable and compliant.  This turned out to be its greatest strength.

In other words, Eich built the initial JavaScript with the intention of it being expanded upon later.  This let it evolve according to the needs of current developers.  Problems that were present in practically every programming language at the time were omitted from JavaScript at the start, allowing them to be fixed later on.

Still, for the first decade or so of its existence, JavaScript was a niche language, not really taken seriously.  A driving factor in its rise to popularity was the book *JavaScript:  The Good Parts* by Douglas Crockford, published in 2008.

The introduction of the V8 engine from Google also helped.  Previously, JavaScript’s applications were limited because its engines were far too slow to support complex operations.  The v8 engine fixed this, though, and paved the way for JavaScript to be integrated into the web more and more.

Fast forward to today, and JavaScript is the dominant programming language on the web.  While it is still far from perfect, it never had to be.  It just had to be good enough, and in the right place at the right time, to catch on.  No doubt there are objectively better languages out there, but JavaScript is so ingrained in every aspect of the web at this point that it is not likely to go away.

One theory is that JavaScript will, at some point in the future, be replaced with a program allowing us to run packages like asm.js at high speeds in a virtual machine sandbox.  This was illustrated by Gary Bernhardt in his talk titled [*The Birth and Death of JavaScript*](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript).
